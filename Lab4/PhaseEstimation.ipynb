Hence the term “phase” in “phase estimation.” The term “estimation” comes about not from the fact that quantum computation is probabilistic, but rather in the degree of precision that we are going to compute, or estimate, the phase to. The most general case of phase estimation is when the phase cannot be written exactly using $n$ bits of precision. In this lecture, we’ll only cover the case where $\\phi$ can be written exactly using $n$ bits.\n",

Then, we control on the first qubit in uniform superposition to implement a controlled-$X$ gate, otherwise known as CNOT. Finally, we implement $H$ again on the top qubit, then measure.
